Mylie Schmidt was involved in roulette sessions from March 10 to March 12, taking part in games scheduled at 5 AM, 8 AM, 2 PM, 8 PM, and 11 PM.
Concurrently, Billy Jones was working at the table during the same period.

It is notable that both Mylie Schmidt and Billy Jones shared a similar roulette play schedule on March 12 and March 15.
This synchronization could be a point of interest for additional analysis or investigation.
